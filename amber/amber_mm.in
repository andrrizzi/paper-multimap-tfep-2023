! Zero step MD to get energy and force.

&cntrl
  ! General options.
  imin=0,                   ! Run MD without minimization.
  ntx=1,                    ! Read coordinates but no velocities.
  irest=0,                  ! Do not restart, this is a new simulation.

  ! Output configuration.
  !ntwr=10000,               ! We don't need to save a restart file (default is nstlim).
  ntpr=1,                   ! Append/save to mdout/mdinfo energy information every step.
  ntwx=1,                   ! Append to mdcrd the coordinates every step.
  ntwf=1,                   ! Append to mdfrc the forces every step.
  ntwe=1,                   ! Append to mden energies and temperatures at every step.
  ioutfm=1,                 ! mdcrd in netcdf format (default is 1).
  idecomp=0,                ! Do not decompose energy (default is 0). This might be handy for the explicit solvent simulation.

  ! MD options.
  nstlim=0,                 ! Total number of MD steps.
  !nscm=1000,                ! No need to recenter the center of mass (default is 1000).
  dt=0.001,                 ! Time step in ps (but we don't step).

  ! Temperature.
  ntt=3,                    ! Use langevin dynamics to control temperature.
  temp0=300,                ! Temperature in Kelvin.
  tempi=300,                ! Initial velocities are drawn from Maxwellian distribution at 300K.
  gamma_ln=5.0,             ! Collision frequency of Langevin dynamics in 1/ps.
  ig=-1,                    ! Seed based on current date and time.
  vlimit=20,                ! Truncate any component of the velocity above 20 (default is 20). A warning is printed when this happens.

  ! Pressure.
  ntp=0,                    ! No pressure control in vacuum. This section needs revision in explicit solvent.

  ! SHAKE.
  ntc=1,                    ! Do not perform SHAKE with QM simulations (unless equilibrium bond lengths are good enough).

  ! Potential parameters.
  ntf=1,                    ! Use all forces for dynamics (change if you SHAKE some bonds).
  !ntb=0,                    ! Turn off periodic boundary conditions in vacuum.
  igb=6,                    ! Vacuum calculation. Automatically sets ntb to 0 to remove periodic boundary conditions.
  !cut=9999,                 ! Nonbonded/PME cutoff in Angstroms (default is 9999 for vacuum/implicit solvent calculations).
